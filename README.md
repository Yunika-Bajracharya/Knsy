Digitalizing the local grocery stores and enabling contactless shopping to avoid virus transmission!

Shopping for groceries and vital products cannot be avoided even during pandemic like this one but there is a constant fear of virus transmission upon visiting these grocery stores. In Nepal, the digitization of grocery stores isn’t very common and in this pandemic, we thought it is the right opportunity to think about it and start digitalizing our local grocery stores.

Idea:

• The customer can order the purchases online, pay for it digitally using either e-banking or services like Khalti, e-sewa, foneplay, etc and after that, you will get a unique code.

• The goods ordered by the customer will be packed by the shopkeepers properly.

• When the customer arrives to pick up the ordered items at the indicated time, one can show the code and get the item in front of the shop itself, no direct contact needed!

• Hence, the risk of infection decreases a lot as the shopkeeper and the customer can do contactless and hygienic sell and buy, otherwise they had to come in contact with the shopkeeper during the transfer of money and goods as well as other customers.

• In this way the shopkeeper doesn’t have to come in contact with many customers so it is safe for both seller and buyer.

• Also during this pandemic, people, in the fear that vital things may run out and not be available later, shop much more than what they actually need at present, so as to save it for future. But this causes an unnecessary shortage of goods and people who can’t afford to buy the products in large quantity will have to suffer. So, with this, we hope to reduce the panic-buying and overbuying of goods as critical items can be kept under limited ordering options.

• Even after the pandemic, this can be a lot of time-saving and hygienic at the same time as we don’t need to roam around the whole store to find our items.
S
• Furthermore, this doesn’t need any additional delivery capacities or costs.

Challenges we ran into:

• We initially used CSS bootstrap framework for the front-end coding but later we found out that it didn’t integrate well with the Vue framework, which we had already decided to work on, so we had to change the design and rewrite the code at the last moment.

Technologies we used:

MEVN stack, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Twitter Bootstrap
